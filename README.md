# :car: Motorized Sumobot :blue_car:

This is the Norfolk.js motorized version of [Pawel's Sumobot-jr](https://github.com/makenai/sumobot-jr) design that we put together for [Norfolk NodeBots Day](http://www.norfolkjs.org/nodebots/index.html). The main change was to the laser-cut side pieces to support gear motors (inspired by [Markus's sumobot](https://github.com/ghtomcat/sumobot)) and the laser-cut wheels have been replaced by rubber wheels. To make this beginner-friendly, we use a motor shield for wiring the motors to the arduino. However, the bot chassis design can support other motor drivers and wiring strategies.

Want to make your own motorized sumobot? Here is the [parts list](https://github.com/norfolkjs/motorized-sumobot/blob/master/parts_list.md).

We also have [printable instructions](https://github.com/norfolkjs/motorized-sumobot/blob/master/assembly-instructions.pdf) and an instructional video! (thanks [Trisha](https://github.com/aureately) and [Paul](https://github.com/paulchinjr))

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
* [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you're using Windows, you'll also need to install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

```
  git clone https://github.com/norfolkjs/motorized-sumobot.git
  cd motorized-sumobot
  npm i
  npm i -g firmata-party
```

### Controlling Your Bot

* Plug your Arduino into your computer's USB port
* Flash your Arduino with the Firmata sketch:
  `firmata-party uno --debug`
* Start the code that controls your bot!
  `npm start`
